# Instructions:

The first notebook Class_Dist can be used to compute the target clusters from target data-sets. There are several examples given for different data-sets. The zip file has class feature representation for ImageNet21k classes. Note that the path might need to be changed.  Requres : tensorflow, keras, pillow, tensorflow_datasets, sklearn.

The second notebook is used to select the closest classes using google operation research tool. requires ortools (availabel at : https://developers.google.com/optimization/assignment/assignment_example)

The third notebook or the python file (.py) can be used for pre-training a model. The rest of the ntoebooksinclude fine-tuning example.
